# java-learning
java is a programing language

Date:19/2/2024
we installed jdk (java development kit)
in that only we have both java and javac commands 
There are three steps 1. Hll - Human learning program
                      2. Lll - computer program
                      3. Mll (machine learning)
java is a high level progrme 
we should convert into machine level
and then to low level 
to convet that we use java and javac command

[] Variables

variables are containers for storing data values 

[] Variable naming conventions

* A variable name can consist of capital letters A-Z only one spwcial characters such as _

* The first character must not be a digit 

* Blank spaces cannot be used in variable names


[] different data types in programming languages

There are four types of data types are there 

1. Integer

Integer data type represent whole numbers in programing 

2. Character

In character data type alphabet letters denote characters and they can be single characters 

3. String

A string data type is acombination of characters that can be either constant or variable

4. Boolean 

Boolean data type contains two types of values true or false 


[] different cases

1. Pascal case 

Pascal case is naming with first letter of each word is capital letter. Pascal case is used for class naming 

Ex: NewWord 

2. Camel case

In camel case first word will be samall letters and from second word firsr character will be capital letter

Ex: iPhone 

3. Snake case

Snake case is naming with words separated by _(underscore) and all small letters 

Ex: new_word

[] what are primitive and non-primitive Data types

1. Primitive Data type 

The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double 

2. 
Non-primitive data type

Non primitive data type include classes, interfaces, and arrays


[] What is memory

Memory is also known as RAM. RAM ram stands for random acces memory and its one of the most fundemental elements of computing. RAM is a temporary memory bank where your computer stores data it needs to retrieve quickly


[] how does program execute 

1. Compilation 

First, the source "java" file is passed through the Computer , which then encodes the source code into a machine-independent encoding, known as Bytecode. 

step1: Reads a set of *java source files and maps the resulting token sequence into AST 

step2: enter symbols for the definitions into the symbol table 

step3: process annotations 

step4: Attribute 

step5: Flow

step6: Desugar 

Step7: Generate

2. Execution

In Execution process there are three steps first CPU take the file from the cashe1 and cashe1 take the file from cashe2 abd cashe2 will take the file from the cashe3 and cashe3 will take file from the hard disk. I

[] what is javac

The javac command reads source files that contain module, package and type declarations written as the java programming language and compiles them into class files that run on the java virtual 

* Source files must have a fie name extention of .java. Class file have a file name extention of .class. Both source and class files normally have file names that identify the contents

[] Given two numbers for example number1=3 and number2 =5
swap the numbers so that when printing number1 it should display num5 and printing number2 it should display num3
